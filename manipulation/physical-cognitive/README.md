Work flow map of the `physical-cognitive` streams of the Portland project
===

The central data transfer object (`dto`) of the `physical-cognitive` stream is produced from a pool of model outputs, stored as text files, that have been generated by an estimation routine in Mplus that has been coordinated among the participating studies.

Some studies used a semi-automatic scripts for running large number of models. The production of the outputs of these models are described in the workflow diagram below
