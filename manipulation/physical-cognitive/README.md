_Describing the production line of the `physical-cognitive` stream of the Portland project_  


The models in `physical-cognitive` stream pair up physical and cognitive measurements in bivariate growth curve models. These models have been estimated against data from separate longitudinal studies using MPlus during a coordinated analysis workshop in Portlan, OR in February 2015. Analysts from participating studies have carried out the estimation on their own computers and submitted text files with model outputs to the collective.

The analysis of this model collective is the primary purpose of these scripts.   


Some studies used a semi-automatic scripts for running large number of models. The production of the outputs of these models are described in the workflow diagram below

The central data transfer object (`dto`) of the `physical-cognitive` stream is produced from a pool of model outputs, stored as text files, that have been generated by an estimation routine in Mplus that has been coordinated among the participating studies.
